**Project Statement:**
The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end data pipeline for New York yellow taxi data ingestion, processing, and analytics. The pipeline will utilize BigQuery as the primary data storage and analytics platform, Postgres as a complementary database for specific use cases, Airflow for workflow orchestration, Spark for distributed data processing, Docker for containerization, and a data lake for storing raw and intermediate data.

**Key objectives of the project include:**

Data Ingestion: Designing and implementing a robust data ingestion process to efficiently capture and load New York yellow taxi data into the data pipeline. 

Data Processing and Analytics: Developing data processing workflows using Airflow and Spark to transform and cleanse the raw data. This includes aggregating, enriching, and filtering the data to create meaningful datasets for analytics purposes. Utilizing BigQuery and Postgres, implement data models and queries to enable advanced analytics and reporting on taxi trips, fares, driver performance, and other relevant metrics.

Infrastructure and Deployment: Setting up Docker containers to package and deploy the data pipeline components, ensuring scalability, portability, and reproducibility. This involves configuring and optimizing the infrastructure to handle the processing demands and data volumes efficiently.

Data Lake Integration: Implementing a data lake architecture to store and manage the raw and intermediate data, providing a central repository for data exploration, ad-hoc analysis, and data archival.

By successfully implementing this project, I aim to provide a scalable, efficient, and comprehensive solution for ingesting, processing, and analyzing big data(New York yellow taxi data). This will enable stakeholders, including transportation authorities, researchers, and businesses, to gain valuable insights, improve decision-making, and optimize various aspects of the taxi industry in New York City.
